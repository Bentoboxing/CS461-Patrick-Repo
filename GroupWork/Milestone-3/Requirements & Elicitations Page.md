## Requirements and Elicitations Work

<br>

How should we allow users to use the site data-wise?
- An initial entry form should be simple, if people want to add more we can add advanced options later. 

Do we want to have different grading scales based upon different regions (ie Europe judges climbs differently from the US)? 
- Yes, we want to have this be something we can add down the pipeline.

Will we allow users to create their own climbs/locations?
- As a stretch epic/goal, we agreed that we can have location adding to our web app and database by users. We're thinking that you would want to use coordinates like GPS as a placeholder.
- We think for data entry with forms that we should be able to enter in on the individual climbs themselves, but also have a form page on its own where you can fill out and log a climb/route.

Do we want people to log attempts on custom routes that don't exist in our database? 
- Our consensus is that no, this will be out of scope for us for now, but possible in the future.

How will we compare our users?
- You can have certain stats that you can measure physical stats with others. You can also compare someone's maximum accomplishments for climbs with others. The main intersection of what matters to
people for comparison will be the grade of the route and the style. 

Is there any problems with our design?
- It seems like for improving personal preformance we might not be able to go as in-detail about improving personal performance. More than likely, we're thinking we need to lean more towards recommendations
and showing general advice for the user to improve their skills. 

Will we add an AI feature to the project?
- We're even considering using a generative AI to give general advice if they're lacking in one of their attributes. For example, we want to feed the AI prompts to see where a user could improve on physically like through exercises.

Any other things to suggest?
- There can be a quiz when creating an account in order to get more information from the user.
- Considering making a robust profile page.

What's the main focus of our analysis when it comes to comparing people?
- Something we want to focus is grade scale like V8, etc, and because that's what rock climbers care about, we want to focus our report/analysis around this. 

What are the major things we're testing?
- For each physical attribute: endurance, max strength, and flexibility it would be beneficial for a user to be able grade people based on exercises they do.

Is there any scope related issues?
- Scope-wise, we need to limit and rank the importance of data that we will track, compare, and ultimately use for a user's analysis. 

What will the profile page include?
- Demographics, personal page, etc will be on the main profile page. There will be also an analytics tab that has the report on your statisics. Another tab that displays a history of that user's climbs showing styles and other details. 

What is a list of our main feature pages?
- So for our main pages, splash page with search bar, we want a routes/climbs/areas page, profiles page (will have profile/stats/climb-history), personal reports page, account/login page.
