Project Inception Worksheet
=====================================

An app to allow users to track and quantify their strengths, weaknesses, and achievements. To help them better understand their strengths and weaknesses by comparing their stats and achievements to other climbers in an objective way. Analyzing trends in users, as well as determining averages for numerous aspects of performance in individuals in the many different levels in climbing. This information can be crucial to high performance focused athletes to help them understand their shortcomings, as well as everyday recreational users who like to track their progress and see how they compare to their friends. This can become very scalable as the system would become more refined and specific to individuals as more data is collected.


## Summary of Our Approach to Software Development
    What processes are we following?  How will we run this project? ==> Agile, Scrum, ...  
    What are we choosing to do, how will we do it and at what level of detail or extent?

## 2: Initial Vision Discussion with Stakeholders
    A web app that allows users to track and view their strengths, weaknesses, achievements, and view a variety of climbs with comparative data from the community. By comparing a user's individual statistics to others, they will have the context to view themselves as a climber accurately and be able to improve efficently with that knowledge. The app will allow users to log their climbing attempts on a wide range of climbs, measure their performance on their attempts, and compare the stats gained from the previous two and compare them with others who attempted the same climb â€” as well as comparing them with friends that you can make on the app. This app is aimed to fill a need for climbers to track their own rock climbing skills, allow them to find climbs at their level, and have a way to compare themselves to others accurately. For tracking and comparing data for rock climbing, there isn't a lot of data that's open source and available to the public. For example, OpenBeta has tons of routes, but it doesn't have much in the way of giving context with personal and community data.

### Description of Clients/Users

### List of Stakeholders and their Positions (if applicable)
    Who are they? Why are they a stakeholder?

## 3a: Initial Requirements Elaboration and Elicitation
    1. It is required for user's to log their climbs and for it to persist.
    2. It is required for the user to see climbing locations.
    3.

### 3c: Elicitation Questions
    1. What information will we need to track for a user's performance on climbs?
    2. What analysis will a user get for their climbing performance?
    3. How will user's be able to compare their performances to others?
    4. How would you find climbing locations?
    5. Will there be a leaderboard system to compare my data to others?
    6. Will I be able to add friends to my account?
    7. Will I be able to compare with my friends' data?
    8. Can I organize community groups?
    9. Will I be able to track my physical strengths? And how will it be broken down?
    10.
