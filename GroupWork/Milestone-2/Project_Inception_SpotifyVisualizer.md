Project Inception Worksheet
=====================================



## Summary of Our Approach to Software Development
    What processes are we following?  How will we run this project? ==> Agile, Scrum, ...  
    What are we choosing to do, how will we do it and at what level of detail or extent?

## 2: Initial Vision Discussion with Stakeholders
    A web app that lets users link up their spotify account and acquire statistics about their playlists, recent activity, and historical data. Users will also be able to get recommendations based on their selected playlists, recent activity/historical top songs, as well as singular tracks. A personality test will also be available to generate a personalized playlist with a customized cover. Advanced recommendations will be available by inputting desired audio features such as mood, liveliness, more acoustics/lyrics, etc. Analysis will be available in the form of trends or statistics about audio features such as tempo, key, valence, energy, and other features provided via the spotify API. (Full list of audio features available on mindmap below). Visualizations will also be generated by the application for playlists, top items, and single tracks. Active visualizer will be available for currently playing track, and generated playlist visualizations can be set as playlist covers from within the application.

    3.

### 3c: Elicitation Questions
    1. What features/statistics can a user find out about songs?
    2. What data can a user get recommendations off of?
    3. What determines a song's mood?
    4. What data will have a visualization?
    5. How will a user input their song data?
    6. Can a user get analysis of both recent and historical listens?
    7. What are audio features?
 
### Elicitation Interviews
    Transcript or summary of what was learned

### Other Elicitation Activities?
    As needed

## 3b: List of Needs and Features
    1. App generates visualization 'mood images' for playlists, top songs, and single tracks.
    2. Active visualizer for currently playing song.
    3. Users can set a generated playlist image as a playlist cover.
    4. Users can get statistics for medium (~6 months) or long term (all time, up to years) listening data.
    5. Users can get recommendations based off of recent listens, a single track, or a playlist.
    6. Users can get recommendations based off of a 'personality test'.
    7. Advanced Recommendations - users input desired 'audio features' such as mood, liveliness, to receive matching songs.
    8. Users can see trends from listening data - ie: most songs are upbeat, 5 of your top songs are in the key of d, etc.
