# Project Ideas

## Spotify Mood Image Generator

An application that connects to a user's spotify account and analyzes their music (ie: recent listens, or a specific playlist), and generates a 'mood image' accordingly. The external API used would be the spotify API, and the application would be translating various song/genre statistics pulled from the API into parameters for generating the image. Found a similar concept online at <https://musicscapes.herokuapp.com>.
Could generate abstract images, or a different type of setting for the result. Not sure if this is too similar to musicScapes after doing research, so could change into a general song statistics anaylsis concept instead.

Example musicScape: ![example generated musicScape][musicScape]
Shows how various aspects of recent listens (tempo, activity, key, emotion) are translated into components of the image.

## ChatGPT/Gemini Pro Recipe Generator

An application where a user inputs ingredients they have (or want to use) and generative AI is used to produce a recipe with ingredients and directions. Users could also specify details for the type of dish they would like a recipe for (Soup, Stir-Fry, Salad, etc) + things like healthy or hearty. Users could edit/save recipes generated with the application. Could possibly expand this by letting users share/publish the recipes as well so that they could be viewed in the application by others. Gemini API is currently free to use which is appealing as an API choice. 

## Rock Climbing Tracker

An app to allow users to track and quantify their strengths, weaknesses, and achievements. To help them better understand their strengths and weaknesses by comparing their stats and achievements to other climbers in an objective way. Analyzing trends in users, as well as determining averages for numerous aspects of performance in individuals in the many different levels in climbing. This information can be crucial to high performance focused athletes to help them understand their shortcomings, as well as everyday recreational users who like to track their progress and see how they compare to their friends. This can become very scalable as the system would become more refined and specific to individuals as more data is collected.

Example scenario: A climber with a maximum weighted pullup of +10 lbs is under the +30 lbs average for their grade of V5, so this could be a valuable data point for them to improve on.
