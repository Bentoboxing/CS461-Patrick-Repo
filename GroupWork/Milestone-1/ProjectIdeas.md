## Spotify Mood Image Generator

An application that connects to a user's spotify account and analyzes their music (ie: recent listens, or a specific playlist), and generates a 'mood image' accordingly. The external API used would be the spotify API, and the application would be translating various song/genre statistics pulled from the API into parameters for generating the image. Found a similar concept online at <https://musicscapes.herokuapp.com>.
Could generate abstract images, or a different type of setting for the result. Not sure if this is too similar to musicScapes after doing research, so could change into a general song statistics anaylsis concept instead.

Example musicScape: ![example generated musicScape][musicScape]
Shows how various aspects of recent listens (tempo, activity, key, emotion) are translated into components of the image.

## ChatGPT/Gemini Pro Recipe Generator

An application where a user inputs ingredients they have (or want to use) and generative AI is used to produce a recipe with ingredients and directions. Users could also specify details for the type of dish they would like a recipe for (Soup, Stir-Fry, Salad, etc) + things like healthy or hearty. Users could edit/save recipes generated with the application. Could possibly expand this by letting users share/publish the recipes as well so that they could be viewed in the application by others. Gemini API is currently free to use which is appealing as an API choice.
